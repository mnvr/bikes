# Helsinki City Bikes Near Me

An iOS app to list the Helsinki city bikes near your location.

The app lists the information on a map. There is also a Notification
Center widget to quickly see the nearest stations with bikes currently
available.

Note that this is a third party app, and is not affiliated with HSL or
the City Bike service.

## Use Case

Helsinki city provides a bike service in the non-winter months. The
bikes are available at docking stations spread throughout the city.

https://www.hsl.fi/en/citybikes

The city bike service also provides a map that lists the stations, and
the number of bikes currently available at each of those.

https://kaupunkipyorat.hsl.fi/en/stations

While this map is great (thanks!), it is often a bit cumbersome to use
for the common case where one is only interested in the number of
bikes available at the docking stations in one's near vicinity, so
that one can quickly decide which way to head.

This app provides that information in a glance.

## API

The good folks in the Finnish government have provided an simple, easy
to use, open source and realtime API that provides the city bike
information.

Kiitos Paljon!
